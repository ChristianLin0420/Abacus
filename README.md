## Description
This project is to let us implement Abacus Algorithm. In the "Reference", you also can refer the paper to implement parallel legalization to speed up your program's speed.

## Reference
1. Abacus: fast legalization of standard cell circuits with minimal movement
2. [Parallel Legalization for Abacus algorithm](https://github.com/ChristianLin0420/Abacus/blob/master/technologies-07-00003.pdf)
